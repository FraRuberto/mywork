## Purpose 

The purpose of this notebook is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset, covering aspects such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. By the end of this exploration, readers will have a clearer understanding of the dataset and the insights it holds. Additionally, this notebook serves as a learning opportunity for those interested in data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.

## Dataset background

The Palmer Penguins dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics and behaviors of three penguin species: Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. The observations include various morphological measurements such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, as well as categorical variables like species, island of origin, and sex.

### Main variables:

- Species: Categorical variable indicating the species of the penguin (Adélie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo).
- Island: Categorical variable indicating the island in the Palmer Archipelago where the penguin was observed.
- Bill Length (mm): Numerical variable representing the length of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
- Bill Depth (mm): Numerical variable representing the depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters.
- Flipper Length (mm): Numerical variable representing the length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters.
- Body Mass (g): Numerical variable representing the body mass of the penguin in grams.
- Sex: Categorical variable indicating the sex of the penguin (male or female).
